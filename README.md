# Batch Renaming Files

I wrote this script which I used to rename all the files when I faced a problem while pulling all the files from my CodeKata repo on Windows. As the Python files on my Linux machine were having special characters in their filenames, I was unable to retrieve all the files from my repo on Windows. 

Using this script I was able to rename all the files in a folder in a way that they can be retrieved on Windows machine without any issues.

Feel free to use it and modify it. If you see any issues then please raise a PR.
